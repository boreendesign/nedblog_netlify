Timothy Kieran O’Mahony, PhD. of the UW Life Center and ICNTL, LLC has been awarded the 2017 Puget Sound Association of Phi Beta Kappa’s Pathfinder Award. The Pathfinder Award reflects the imagery on the Phi Beta Kappa key, a hand pointing to the stars.  It honors those who encourage others to seek new worlds to discover, pathways to explore, and untouched destinations to reach.  Kieran was selected for this award for his work on his pedagogical model and software (Synap2Brane), which is a neuroscience-based teaching and learning methodology.

The award recognizes Kieran’s program to “teach the teachers” how to apply Synap2Brane in their classrooms, working with 1,500+ educators while he continues to seek funding to develop the software. ICNTL (Institute for Connecting Neuroscience with Teaching and Learning) seeks to foster a supportive, healthy learning environment that recognizes all students learn at different rates with different levels of support.  

Today, Synap2Brane has evolved into NED Learning (Neuroscience EDucation) an easily recognizable brand for a wider range of audiences. Kieran and the NED Learning Team's vision for this methodology is to bring innovation to the learning world, through evidence-based neuroscience research.
